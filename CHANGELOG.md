## [1.2.0] - 2025-11-16

### 🏗️ Major Refactoring - Simplified Architecture

**Architectural simplification: Focus on segmentation-only approach**

Removed the complex calibration/detection system in favor of a simpler, more maintainable segmentation-only architecture:

- **Removed modules** (6 files, ~2,140 lines):
  * `calibration.c/h` - Complex calibration system
  * `detection_engine.c/h` - Multi-state detection engine
  * `statistics.c/h` - Statistics buffer and analysis

- **Simplified core files**:
  * `espectre.c`: 900 → 557 lines (-38%, -343 lines)
  * `mqtt_commands.c`: 966 → 604 lines (-37%, -362 lines)
  * Total reduction: ~2,845 lines removed

- **New architecture**:
  ```
  CSI Packet → Segmentation (always) → IF MOTION && features_enabled:
                                          → Extract Features
                                          → Publish with features
                                       ELSE:
                                          → Publish without features
  ```

- **Removed MQTT commands** (8 commands):
  * `detection_threshold` - No longer needed
  * `calibrate` - Calibration system removed
  * `analyze` - Statistics analysis removed
  * `features` - Feature display removed
  * `stats` - Statistics buffer removed
  * `debounce` - Detection debouncing removed
  * `persistence` - Detection persistence removed
  * `hysteresis` - Detection hysteresis removed

- **Added MQTT commands**:
  * `features_enable <on|off>` - Toggle feature extraction during MOTION state

- **Simplified configuration**:
  * Removed: `debounce_count`, `hysteresis_ratio`, `persistence_timeout`, `feature_weights[]`
  * Removed: `threshold_high`, `threshold_low` (detection thresholds)
  * Added: `features_enabled` (bool, default: true)
  * NVS version incremented to 6

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Simpler codebase (~2,845 lines removed, -60% complexity)
- ✅ Easier to understand and maintain
- ✅ Focus on proven MVS algorithm
- ✅ Optional feature extraction (performance optimization)
- ✅ Cleaner MQTT API (10 commands instead of 18)

    ...
  },
  "timestamp": 1730066405
}
```

### ✨ Added - Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) Module

  * Implements Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) algorithm with adaptive threshold
  * Extracts motion segments from CSI data in real-time
  * Calculates statistical features per segment (duration, avg/max turbulence)
  * Circular buffer maintains up to 10 recent segments
  
- **Spatial turbulence calculation**: New `csi_calculate_spatial_turbulence()` function
  * Calculates standard deviation of subcarrier amplitudes

### 🚀 Major - Amplitude-Based Skewness & Kurtosis

**Performance breakthrough: +151% separation improvement**

Based on analysis of 6 scientific papers on Wi-Fi CSI sensing, implemented amplitude-based approach for skewness and kurtosis:

- **Amplitude-based pipeline**:
  1. Convert raw bytes (I+jQ) → amplitude |h| = √(I² + Q²) for each subcarrier
  2. Aggregate all subcarriers → single amplitude value per packet
  3. Maintain 20-packet circular buffer for temporal analysis
  4. Calculate statistical moments (m2, m3, m4) on amplitude time series
  
- **Shared buffer optimization**:
  * Skewness and kurtosis share same `amplitude_moments_buffer`
  * Cached moments (m2, m4) reused between features
  * Zero memory overhead, ~5% CPU overhead
  
- **Results**:
  * **Skewness**: 2.91x separation (vs 1.16x previous), 82.3% accuracy, 0% false positives
  * **Kurtosis**: 2.47x separation (+79% vs raw kurtosis)
  * **Combined**: Calibrator selects both as dominant features (68% total weight)

### 🚀 Improved - Traffic Generator

**Reliable CSI packet generation with bidirectional traffic**

- **ICMP ping-based**: Replaced UDP broadcast with ICMP Echo Request/Reply
- **ESP-IDF ping component**: Uses official `ping/ping_sock.h` API
- **Bidirectional traffic**: Guaranteed request + reply for CSI generation
- **Auto-discovery**: Automatically targets WiFi gateway
- **Robust implementation**: Thread-safe, tested, maintained by Espressif
- **Statistics**: Success/timeout tracking with callbacks

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Reliable CSI packet generation on every ping reply
- ✅ No external dependencies (uses gateway)
- ✅ Simpler code (~200 lines vs manual ICMP implementation)
- ✅ Better error handling and logging

**Technical details:**
- Previous: UDP broadcast (no reply, unreliable CSI generation)
- Current: ICMP ping to gateway (bidirectional, reliable CSI on reply)
- Configurable rate: 1-50 pps
- Automatic gateway IP discovery from network interface

### 🚀 Improved - CSI Subcarrier Optimization

**Maximum spatial information: Reading ALL available subcarriers**

Based on ESP32-S3 Wi-Fi documentation analysis, optimized CSI data collection to capture complete channel information:

- **Channel filter disabled**: Changed `channel_filter_en` from `true` to `false`
  * Now receives ALL 64 subcarriers instead of 52 (+23% spatial information)
  * Includes edge subcarriers (-32 to -27 and +27 to +32) previously filtered
  * More complete frequency response of the channel
  
**Benefits:**
- ✅ +23% more spatial information (64 vs 52 subcarriers)
- ✅ Better movement detection accuracy
- ✅ More data for calibration optimization
- ✅ Higher spatial resolution

### ✨ Added - Temporal Features

**Enhanced feature set: Expanded from 8 to 10 features**

- **New temporal features**: Added 2 temporal features that track changes between consecutive CSI packets
  - `temporal_delta_mean`: Average absolute difference from previous packet
  - `temporal_delta_variance`: Variance of differences from previous packet
- **Improved detection**: Temporal features capture movement dynamics over time
- **Backward compatible**: Existing calibrations continue to work with the expanded feature set

**Feature set now includes:**
- **Statistical** (5): variance, skewness, kurtosis, entropy, iqr
- **Spatial** (3): spatial_variance, spatial_correlation, spatial_gradient
- **Temporal** (2): temporal_delta_mean, temporal_delta_variance

### 🔧 Changed - Modified Fisher Criterion

**Improved feature selection algorithm**

- **Modified Fisher Score**: Changed from standard Fisher `(μ₁ - μ₂)² / (σ₁² + σ₂²)` to Modified Fisher `(μ₁ - μ₂)² / √(σ₁² + σ₂²)`
- **Pre-normalization**: All features normalized to [0,1] before Fisher calculation
  * Eliminates bias towards features with large absolute values
  * Ensures fair comparison between features
  * Skewness/kurtosis now correctly selected as top features
- **Benefits**: 
  - Less penalty for features with high variance
  - Better selection of features with strong signal separation
  - More robust in noisy environments
- **Configurable**: Can be toggled via `USE_MODIFIED_FISHER` flag in `calibration.c`

### 🧪 Added - Local Segmentation Test Script

**Python tool for rapid parameter tuning without device flashing**

- **test_segmentation_local.py**: Replicates ESP32 segmentation algorithm locally
  * Implements Moving Variance Segmentation (MVS) with adaptive threshold
  * Calculates spatial turbulence from CSI packets
  * Extracts statistical features from motion segments
  * Includes Random Forest classifier for validation
  * Interactive visualization of segmentation results

- ✅ Validates C code implementation in Python

**Usage:**
```bash
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py              # Run with defaults
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py --optimize   # Find optimal parameters
python test_app/test_segmentation_local.py --no-plot    # Skip visualization
```

### ✨ Added - CSI Raw Data Collection

**Dataset generation for testing and analysis**
- **Calibration data export**: Extended `calibrate` command to print CSI raw data during calibration

**Usage:**
```bash
espectre> calibrate start 100 verbose
```

### 🗑️ Removed - Adaptive Normalizer

**Code simplification: Removed adaptive normalizer filter**

The adaptive normalizer has been removed to simplify the codebase and reduce computational overhead:

- **Simplified filter pipeline**:
  ```
  Butterworth (ON) → Wavelet (OFF) → Hampel (OFF) → Savitzky-Golay (ON)
  ```
**Rationale:**
The adaptive normalizer was primarily used for monitoring/debugging and did not directly affect signal processing or motion detection. Its removal simplifies the system while maintaining all core functionality.
