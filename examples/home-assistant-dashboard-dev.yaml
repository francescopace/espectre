# ESPectre - Home Assistant Dashboard for Development
#
# Extended dashboard with debug sensors for monitoring device health:
# - Free Heap: Available memory (should stay stable)
# - Max Free Block: Largest contiguous memory block
# - Loop Time: Main loop execution time (lower is better)
#
# Use this with espectre-*-dev.yaml configurations that include debug sensors.
# For production, use home-assistant-dashboard.yaml instead.
#
# How to use:
# 1. Go to Settings → Dashboards → Add Dashboard
# 2. Click "Edit" on the new dashboard
# 3. Click the three dots menu → "Raw configuration editor"
# 4. Paste this YAML content
#
# Note: If you changed the device name from "espectre", replace all
# occurrences of "espectre_" with your device name (e.g., "espectre_living_room_")
#
# ⚠️ Multiple devices? If you uncommented "name_add_mac_suffix: true" in your
# device YAML, entity names will include the MAC suffix (e.g., "espectre_a1b2c3").
# Replace "espectre_" with "espectre_XXXXXX_" where XXXXXX is your MAC suffix.
