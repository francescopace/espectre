# Tuning Guide

Quick guide to tune ESPectre for reliable movement detection in your environment.

---

## Quick Start (5 minutes)

> **📌 Note on Subcarrier Selection**: ESPectre automatically selects optimal subcarriers using the NBVI (Normalized Baseline Variability Index) algorithm at first boot. No manual configuration needed.

### 1. Flash and Boot

After flashing your device with ESPHome:

```bash
# View logs to monitor calibration
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml
```

### 2. Wait for NBVI Calibration

On first boot, keep the room **empty and still** for 10 seconds. The system will:
1. Collect 1000 CSI packets
2. Analyze subcarrier characteristics
3. Select optimal 12 subcarriers
4. Save configuration (persists across reboots)

Look for log messages like:
```
[I][espectre:xxx]: NBVI calibration complete, selected 12 subcarriers
```

### 3. Test Movement

Walk around the room while monitoring logs:

```bash
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml
```

Look for state changes:
- `state=MOTION` when moving
- `state=IDLE` when still

### 4. Adjust Threshold if Needed

If detection isn't working well, modify `segmentation_threshold` in your YAML:

```yaml
espectre:
  segmentation_threshold: 1.0  # Default
```

**Rule of thumb:**
- Too many false positives → increase threshold (try 2.0-5.0)
- Missing movements → decrease threshold (try 0.5-0.8)

After changing, re-flash:
```bash
esphome run <your-config>.yaml
```

## Understanding Parameters

### Segmentation Threshold (0.5-10.0)

**What it does:** Determines sensitivity for motion detection.

**Default:** 1.0

| Value | Sensitivity | Use Case |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| 0.5-1.0 | High | Detect subtle movements, quiet environments |
| 1.0-3.0 | Medium | General purpose, most environments |
| 3.0-5.0 | Low | Noisy environments, reduce false positives |
| 5.0-10.0 | Very Low | Only detect significant movements |

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  segmentation_threshold: 1.0
```

### Window Size (10-200 packets)

**What it does:** Number of turbulence samples used to calculate moving variance.

**Default:** 50 packets

| Value | Response | Stability | Use Case |
|-------|----------|-----------|----------|
| 10-30 | Fast | Noisy | Quick response needed |
| 50-100 | Balanced | Good | **Recommended** |
| 100-200 | Slow | Very stable | Reduce flickering |

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  segmentation_window_size: 50
```

<details>
<summary><b>📊 Optimal Window Configuration Guide</b></summary>

To detect general movement (walking, arm movement, standing up), you need to balance **sensitivity** (capturing even minimal movements) and **robustness** (ignoring noise).

**Sampling Rate ($F_s$)**

Maintaining $F_s = 100 \text{ Hz}$ is an excellent compromise between accuracy and computational load for detecting most human activities.

**Moving Window Size ($N$)**

For general movement detection, a window is recommended that captures transient action while being long enough to dampen high-frequency noise.

| $T_{window}$ | $N$ (at 100 Hz) | Advantage for Presence Detection |
|--------------|-----------------|----------------------------------|
| $0.5$ seconds | $50$ packets | Extremely reactive, but too sensitive to noise. |
| $1$ second | $100$ packets | **Recommended**. Optimal balance, captures $1-2$ steps or a complete gesture. |
| $2$ seconds | $200$ packets | Slower to react, but very robust against false positives. |

**Recommendation:** Start with $N=50$ packets (corresponding to $0.5$ seconds). This is a good starting point for detecting activities like entering a room.

</details>

### Traffic Generator Rate (0-1000 pps)

**What it does:** Controls how many packets per second are sent for CSI measurement.

**Default:** 100 pps

| Rate | Use Case |
|------|----------|
| 50 pps | Basic presence detection, minimal overhead |
| 100 pps | **Recommended** - Activity recognition |
| 600-1000 pps | Fast motion detection, precision localization |
| 0 pps | Disabled (only if you have other continuous WiFi traffic) |

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  traffic_generator_rate: 100
```

<details>
<summary><b>📐 Understanding Sampling Rates (Nyquist-Shannon Theorem)</b></summary>

The traffic generator rate determines the maximum frequency of motion that can be accurately detected. According to the **Nyquist-Shannon Sampling Theorem**, the sampling rate (Fs) must be at least twice the maximum frequency of the signal (Fmax):

$$F_s \geq 2 \times F_{max}$$

In Wi-Fi sensing, Fmax is the highest Doppler frequency generated by human movement reflected in the CSI signal.

**Application Scenarios:**

| Activity Type | Max Frequency (Fmax) | Minimum Sampling Rate (Fs) | Recommended Rate |
|---------------|---------------------|---------------------------|------------------|
| **Vital signs** (breathing, heartbeat) | < 5 Hz | ≥ 10 Hz | 10-30 pps |
| **Activity recognition** (walking, sitting, gestures) | ≈ 10-30 Hz | ≥ 60 Hz | 60-100 pps |
| **Fast motion** (rapid gestures, precision localization) | ≈ 300-400 Hz | ≥ 600 Hz | 600-1000 pps |

**Key Takeaways:**
- Higher rates enable detection of faster movements
- Lower rates are sufficient for slow movements (vital signs, presence)
- Choose the rate based on your application requirements
- Higher rates increase CPU usage and network traffic

## Low-Pass Filter

### Low-Pass Filter (Noise Reduction)

**What it does:** Removes high-frequency noise from turbulence values using a 1st-order Butterworth IIR filter. This significantly reduces false positives in noisy RF environments.

**Default:** Disabled

> ℹ️ **Note:** The low-pass filter is disabled by default for maximum simplicity. Enable it if you experience false positives in noisy RF environments.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  lowpass_enabled: false    # Enable/disable (default: false)
  lowpass_cutoff: 11.0      # Cutoff frequency in Hz (5.0-20.0)
```

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `lowpass_enabled` | false | - | Enable/disable low-pass filter |
| `lowpass_cutoff` | 11.0 | 5.0-20.0 | Cutoff frequency in Hz (lower = more filtering) |

**Cutoff frequency guide:**
- **Lower (5-8 Hz)**: More aggressive filtering, reduces FP more but may miss fast movements
- **Default (11 Hz)**: Good balance (92% recall, <3% FP)
- **Higher (15-20 Hz)**: Less filtering, higher recall but more FP

**When to adjust:**
- Increase cutoff if detecting fast movements (sports, rapid gestures)
- Decrease cutoff in very noisy RF environments with persistent FP

## Hampel Filter

### Hampel Filter (Outlier Removal)

**What it does:** Removes statistical outliers from turbulence values using MAD (Median Absolute Deviation). This can help reduce false positives caused by sudden interference.

**Default:** Disabled

> ⚠️ **Note:** The Hampel filter is disabled by default because MVS already provides robust motion detection with 0% false positives in typical environments. Enabling it reduces detection sensitivity (Recall drops from 98.1% to 96.3%). Only enable in environments with high electromagnetic interference causing sudden spikes.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  hampel_enabled: false    # Enable/disable (default: false)
  hampel_window: 7         # Window size (3-11 packets)
  hampel_threshold: 4.0    # MAD multiplier (1.0-10.0, lower = more aggressive)
```

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `hampel_enabled` | false | - | Enable/disable Hampel filter |
| `hampel_window` | 7 | 3-11 | Number of samples in the sliding window |
| `hampel_threshold` | 4.0 | 1.0-10.0 | MAD multiplier (lower = more aggressive filtering) |

**When to enable:**
- Environments with high electromagnetic interference causing sudden spikes
- Industrial settings with heavy machinery
- Proximity to microwave ovens or multiple WiFi access points
- Experiencing unexplained false positives during baseline (room empty)

**When to keep disabled (default):**
- Normal home/office environment
- Maximum detection sensitivity needed

## Normalization (Auto-Scaling)

### Amplitude Normalization

**What it does:** Automatically scales CSI amplitudes during calibration to ensure consistent motion detection across different ESP32 variants (S3, C6, etc.). Different chips produce CSI data with different amplitude ranges.

**Default:** Disabled

> ℹ️ **Note:** Normalization is disabled by default for maximum simplicity. Enable it if you deploy on multiple ESP32 variants (S3, C6, etc.) and need consistent behavior across devices.

**Configuration:**
```yaml
espectre:
  normalization_enabled: false  # Enable/disable (default: false)
  normalization_target: 28.0    # Target mean amplitude (10.0-100.0)
```

| Parameter | Default | Range | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------|-------------|
| `normalization_enabled` | false | - | Enable/disable amplitude normalization |
| `normalization_target` | 28.0 | 10-100 | Target mean amplitude after normalization |

**How it works:**
1. During NBVI calibration, calculates average magnitude of selected subcarriers
2. Computes scale factor: `scale = target / avg_magnitude`
3. Applies scale to all turbulence values during processing

**When to disable:**
- Testing raw CSI values without modification
- Advanced debugging/analysis
- When manually tuning threshold per-device

**When to adjust target:**
- Lower target (20-25): Reduces sensitivity, fewer false positives
- Higher target (30-40): Increases sensitivity, may increase false positives

## Troubleshooting

### Too Many False Positives

**Symptoms:** Detects motion when room is empty.

**Solutions (try in order):**

1. **Increase threshold:**
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_threshold: 3.0  # Try 2.0-5.0
   ```

2. **Increase window size** (more stable):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_window_size: 100  # Try 100-150
   ```

3. **Enable low-pass filter** (removes RF noise):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     lowpass_enabled: true
     lowpass_cutoff: 11.0
   ```

4. **Enable Hampel filter** (removes spikes from interference):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     hampel_enabled: true
   ```

5. **Check for interference sources:**
   - Fans, AC units, moving curtains
   - Microwave ovens, other WiFi networks
   - Bluetooth devices, cordless phones
   - Pets moving in the room

6. **Re-calibrate:** Reset calibration (see below) in a quiet room

### Missing Movements

**Symptoms:** Doesn't detect when people move.

**Solutions (try in order):**

1. **Decrease threshold:**
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_threshold: 0.5  # Try 0.5-0.8
   ```

2. **Decrease window size** (faster response):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_window_size: 30  # Try 25-40
   ```

3. **Check sensor position:**
   - Optimal: 3-8m from router
   - Avoid placing behind furniture or walls
   - Line of sight to monitored area helps

4. **Verify traffic generator is active:**
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     traffic_generator_rate: 100  # Must be > 0
   ```

### No CSI Packets

**Symptoms:** Logs show no CSI data or "CSI disabled".

**Solutions:**

1. **Verify WiFi connection:** Check logs for successful connection to AP

2. **Check traffic generator:**
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     traffic_generator_rate: 100  # Must be > 0
   ```

3. **Verify ESP-IDF configuration:** Ensure `CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_CSI_ENABLED: y` in sdkconfig

4. **Check router compatibility:** Some mesh routers or WiFi 6E may have issues

### Unstable Detection (Flickering)

**Symptoms:** Rapid flickering between IDLE and MOTION.

**Solutions:**

1. **Increase threshold:**
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_threshold: 2.0
   ```

2. **Increase window size** (smooths transitions):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     segmentation_window_size: 100
   ```

3. **Enable low-pass filter** (removes noise):
   ```yaml
   espectre:
     lowpass_enabled: true
   ```

### Reset Calibration

**When needed:** Start fresh with new subcarrier selection.

**How to reset:**

1. Erase flash completely:
   ```bash
   esphome run <your-config>.yaml --device /dev/ttyUSB0
   # Choose "Erase flash before uploading" if available
   ```

2. Or use ESPHome dashboard: **Clean Build Files** then re-install

**After reset:**
- Keep room quiet and empty for 10 seconds
- NBVI will automatically recalibrate
- Check logs for "NBVI calibration complete"

## Monitoring

### View Real-Time Logs

```bash
# Via USB
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml

# Via network (after first flash)
esphome logs <your-config>.yaml --device espectre.local
```

### Home Assistant

After integration, monitor sensors in Home Assistant:
- **binary_sensor.espectre_motion_detected** - Motion state
- **sensor.espectre_movement_score** - Movement intensity
- **number.espectre_threshold** - Adjustable detection threshold

Use **History** graphs to visualize detection patterns over time.

**Tip:** You can adjust the threshold directly from Home Assistant without re-flashing. Changes are saved to device preferences and persist across reboots.

---

## Quick Tips

1. **Start simple:** Tune only the segmentation threshold first
2. **One change at a time:** Adjust one parameter, re-flash, test for 5-10 minutes
3. **Document your settings:** Note what works for your environment
4. **Seasonal adjustments:** Retune when furniture changes or new interference sources appear
5. **Distance matters:** Keep sensor 3-8m from router for optimal performance
6. **Quiet calibration:** Ensure no movement during first 5-10 seconds after boot
